This article describes Cobb County, Georgia's development pattern and the tax value created by each parcel of land in the county. As the title alludes to, it describes why Cobb
County isn't growing lasting wealth; the county doesn't have any high-value downtown areas. Because of its sprawl, any valuable pieces of land (such as a hotel or an office
building) must include a parking lot and drainage facility to accommodate the impermeable parking lot. Because of this, the tax value per acre is quite low across the county.
This is shown through interesting spatial visualizations throughout the article, where each parcel's height corresponds to its tax value. 

This article really spoke to me because it illustrates the type of work I hope to do in my career: it uses analysis tools (in this case, fiscal analysis to determine the tax value
per acre and spatial analysis to present that data) to support an important point about urban planning. My data science goal is to be well-versed enough in analysis that I can
support my claims and beliefs in the urban planning sphere with well-reasoned and well-presented analysis.
