I found Geoff's work and presentation so interesting! Griddidness is so important but so underdiscussed. We talk about land use all the time, and it's really important, but
buildings will go up and down many times before the grid changes; that's how permanent it is. I look at a place like Orlando and just wonder how their street network could ever
become walkable and transit friendly. However, I look at a place like LA and think this place has so much potential for great walkability and transit service! I was especially
interested in the question regarding the correlation between wealth and gridded street networks. I think it's really important to point out that street networks in wealthy neighborhoods
are often curvy because of the wealth there, not the other way around. I really enjoyed the presentation and look forward to discussing further in class!
