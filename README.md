# Profile
This repository belongs to Bryan Graveline. I'm a first year Master of Urban Planning student at UCLA concentrating in Transportation Planning and Policy. 

# Course Description
This repository is for UP 206a Introduction to GIS. The course focuses on spatial data science methodologies with an emphasis on Python.

# Project Ideas
The project idea I described in class involves a comparison between different land use development patterns. I would look at the number of opportunities the typical resident in a
compact development pattern has access to and compare that to the number of opportunities a person in a sprawling development pattern has access to, both within a 30-minute travel
shed and controlled for economic prosperity. This exercise would likely include ACS data, NHTS data, and/or other data sources.

# Class Objectives
Through this class, I hope to gain a better understanding of the various tools I can use to conduct spatial data analysis. So far, I have a fairly robust background in ESRI GIS.
However, I'm hoping to learn more about Python and other open-source analysis tools.
